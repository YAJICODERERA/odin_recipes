    <H4>Steps</H4>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper or silicone baking mat.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. You can use a hand mixer or stand mixer for this step.</li>
        <li>Add the vanilla extract and mix until well combined.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the flour to the butter mixture, mixing until a dough forms. If desired, add a pinch of salt to enhance the flavor of the cookies.</li>
        <li>Shape the cookie dough into small balls, about 1 inch in diameter, and place them on the prepared baking sheet, leaving some space between each cookie.</li>
        <li>If you want to add extra sweetness and a decorative touch, you can roll each cookie ball in granulated sugar before placing them on the baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Use a fork to gently flatten each cookie ball, creating a crisscross pattern on top.</li>
        <li>Remove the cookies from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        <li>Once cooled, store the butter cookies in an airtight container at room temperature. Enjoy!</li>
