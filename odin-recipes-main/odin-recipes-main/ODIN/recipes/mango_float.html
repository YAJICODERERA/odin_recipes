      <li>2 cups heavy cream, chilled</li>
      <li>1 can (14 ounces) sweetened condensed milk</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>

    <ol type="1">
        <li>In a mixing bowl, whip the heavy cream until it forms stiff peaks. You can use a hand mixer or stand mixer for this step. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li>Slowly pour the condensed milk into the whipped cream, and add the vanilla extract. Gently fold the mixture until well combined. This will be your cream mixture.</li>
        <li>In a rectangular dish or any serving container of your choice, arrange a layer of graham crackers at the bottom. You may need to break some crackers to fit the gaps.</li>
        <li>Spread a layer of the cream mixture over the graham crackers, making sure to cover them evenly.</li>
        <li>Arrange a layer of sliced mangoes on top of the cream mixture.</li>
        <li>Repeat the layers until you reach the desired height or until you run out of ingredients.</li>
        <li>Finish with a final layer of cream mixture on top.</li>
        <li>Cover the dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight to allow the flavors to meld and the dessert to set.</li>
        <li>Once chilled and set, slice and serve the mango float cold. Enjoy!</li>
