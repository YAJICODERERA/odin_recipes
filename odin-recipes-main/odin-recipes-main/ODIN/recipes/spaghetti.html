      <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>

    <H4>Steps</H4>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Cook the spaghetti according to the package instructions in a large pot of salted boiling water until al dente. Drain and set aside, reserving some pasta water.</li>
        <li>While the pasta is cooking, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and chopped onion, and saut√© until fragrant and the onions are translucent, about 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in the diced tomatoes (with their juices) and tomato paste. Cook for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Add the salt and pepper to the skillet. Stir well to combine, and let the sauce simmer for about 10-15 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld and the sauce to thicken slightly. If the sauce becomes too thick, you can add a splash of reserved pasta water to thin it out.</li>
        <li>Once the sauce is ready, add the cooked spaghetti to the skillet. Toss the pasta in the sauce until evenly coated.</li>
        <li>Serve the spaghetti hot, garnished with grated Parmesan cheese and fresh basil leaves if desired.</li>
    </ol>
